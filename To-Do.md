# To do: Programming

    - [ ] Add feedback: "You have completed level X!"
    - [X] Add restart option
    - [X] Add next level option

# To do: Content
- [ ] Add more levels
- [ ] Audio per level?

# Done
- [X] Fix bug: When combining Droplets of different sizes, the newly created Droplets must be spaced far enough from eachother so they don't immediately merge after Undo --> Increase space between new formed Droplets (probably distance = radius)
- [X] Reduce delay on finish screen to 0.25 seconds
- [X] Add pixel to brown blobs: (153,204,255)
- [X] Add Chapter + Number to level selection screen (e.g.: Chapter 2)
- [X] Add Completed inlevervakken to right corner of screen to indicate the amount of inlevervakken the user has completed
- [X] Disable Undo when finishing a level
- [X] Add one second delay before overlay starts when winning. We want this to let the player see the result at the first levels
- [X] Add titlescreen
- [X] Fix bug: Droplet doesn't stick in submitzone
- [X] Reduce Button flashes in Titlescreen and Chaptermenu (probably unfixable in-game) (http://www.angryhacker.com/blog/archive/2010/07/21/how-to-get-rid-of-flicker-on-windows-forms-applications.aspx)
- [X] Change Submitzones completion font color to the same color as the buttons
- [X] Fix bug where White + Color has wrong placement of Droplets (they are too close to eachother)
