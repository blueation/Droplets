# To do: Programming
- [ ] Reduce delay on finish screen to 0.75 seconds
- [ ] Fix bug: When combining Droplets of different sizes, the newly created Droplets must be spaced far enough from eachother so they don't immediately merge after Undo --> Increase space between new formed Droplets (probably distance = radius)
- [ ] Create winning screen
    - [ ] Add feedback: "You have completed level X!"
    - [X] Add restart option
    - [X] Add next level option
- [ ] Reduce Button flashes in Titlescreen and Chaptermenu (probably unfixable in-game) (http://www.angryhacker.com/blog/archive/2010/07/21/how-to-get-rid-of-flicker-on-windows-forms-applications.aspx)
- [ ] Add pixel to brown blobs: (153,204,255)

# To do: Content
- [ ] Add more levels
- [ ] Add proper audio

# Done

- [X] Add titlescreen
