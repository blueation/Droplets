# Droplets

Droplets is a game made for the 2014-2015 Game-ontwerp course by S.F.A.M. "Blueation" Brouwer, Yorick "Yorici" van Zweeden, Jelmer van Nuss and Gerco Wassink.

The game is a simple game in which the player has to drag droplets to stretch them and make those droplets combine into new droplets with new colours. The levels are completed by having a droplet of the correct colour rest in each of the submission zones.

The game is made to fit the "Submission" aesthetic, and will feature a relatively slow difficulty curve and a calming atmosphere.
