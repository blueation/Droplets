# Droplets

Droplets is a game made for the 2014-2015 game-ontwerp course by S.F.A.M. Brouwer ("Blueation"), Yorick van Zweeden ("Yorici"), Jelmer van Nuss (??) and Gerco Wassink (??).

The game is a simple game in which the player has to drag droplets to stretch them and make those droplets combine into new droplets with new colours. The levels are completed by having a droplet of the correct colour rest in each of the submission zones.

The game is made to fit the "Submission" aesthetic, and will feature a realtively slow difficulty curve and a calming atmosphere.
